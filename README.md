Project Euler--First 100 Solutions

This repository contains the first 100 solutions to Project Euler (in progress). The project aims to provide clean, readable solutions using Python code while documenting my journey in
mathematical problem solving and programming skills development. 

Purpose:

  1. Develop and deepen my knowledge of mathematics
  2. Strengthen problem solving skills
  3. Promote Project Euler as an excellent resource for clever mathematical and programming challenges.
